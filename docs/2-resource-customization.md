# Working with Resources

Every Active Admin resource corresponds to a Rails model. So before creating a
resource you must first create a Rails model for it.

## Create a Resource

The basic command for creating a resource is `rails g active_admin:resource Post`.
The generator will produce an empty `app/admin/posts.rb` file like so:

```ruby
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Post do |config|
  # ...
end
```

TODO: and an empty `app/controllers/admin/posts_controller.rb` file like so:

```ruby
class Admin::PostsController < ActiveAdmin::ResourceController
  # ...
end
```

## Setting up Strong Parameters

Override the [permitted_attr_names] method to define which attributes may be changed:

```ruby
class Admin::PostsController < ActiveAdmin::ResourceController
  def permitted_attr_names
    [:title, :content, :publisher_id]
  end
end
```

or more directly, override [permitted_params]:

```ruby
class Admin::PostsController < ActiveAdmin::ResourceController
  def permitted_params
    params.permit(post: [:title, :content, :publisher_id])
  end
end
```

Any form field that sends multiple values (such as a HABTM association, or an
array attribute) needs to pass an empty array:

If your HABTM is `roles`, you should permit `role_ids: []`

```ruby
class Admin::PostsController < ActiveAdmin::ResourceController
  def permitted_attr_names
    [:title, :content, :publisher_id, role_ids: []]
  end
end
```

Nested associations in the same form also require an array, but it
needs to be filled with any attributes used.

```ruby
class Admin::PostsController < ActiveAdmin::ResourceController
  def permitted_attr_names
    [:title, :content, :publisher_id,
    tags_attributes: [:id, :name, :description, :_destroy]]
  end
end

# Note that `accepts_nested_attributes_for` is still required:
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :tags, allow_destroy: true
end
```

If you want to dynamically choose which attributes can be set:

```ruby
class Admin::PostsController < ActiveAdmin::ResourceController
  def permitted_attr_names
    params = [:title, :content, :publisher_id]
    params.push :author_id if current_user.admin?
    params
  end
end
```

[permitted_attr_names] is called by a method called [permitted_params]. You should
use this method when overriding `create` or `update` actions:

```ruby
class Admin::PostsController < ActiveAdmin::ResourceController
  def create
    # Good
    @post = Post.new(permitted_params[:post])
    # Bad
    @post = Post.new(params[:post])

    if @post.save
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

## Disabling Actions on a Resource

All CRUD actions are enabled by default. These can be disabled for a given resource:

```ruby
class Admin::PostsController < ActiveAdmin::ResourceController
  actions :all, except: [:update, :destroy]
end
```

## Renaming Action Items

You can use translations to override labels and page titles for actions such as
new, edit, and destroy by providing a resource specific translation.  For
example, to change 'New Offer' to 'Make an Offer' add the following in
config/locales/[en].yml:

```yaml
en:
  active_admin:
    resources:
      offer: # Registered resource
        new_model: 'Make an Offer' # new action item
        edit_model: 'Change Offer' # edit action item
        delete_model: 'Cancel Offer' # delete action item
```

See the [default en.yml](/config/locales/en.yml) locale file for
existing translations and examples.

## Rename the Resource

By default, any references to the resource (menu, routes, buttons, etc) in the
interface will use the name of the class. You can rename the resource by using
the `:as` option.

```ruby
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Post, as: "Article"
```

The resource will then be available at `/admin/articles`.
The controller and view names should be updated also.

## Customize the Namespace

We use the `admin` namespace by default, but you can use anything:

```ruby
# Available at /today/posts
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Post, namespace: :today

# Available at /posts
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Post, namespace: false
```

## Customize the Menu

The resource will be displayed in the global navigation by default. To disable
the resource from being displayed in the global navigation:

```ruby
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Post do |config|
  config.menu_item_options = false
end
```

Menu item options include:

* `:label` - The string or proc label to display in the menu. If it's a proc, it
  will be called each time the menu is rendered.
* `:parent` - The string id (or label) of the parent used for this menu
* `:if` - A block or a symbol of a method to call to decide if the menu item
  should be displayed
* `:priority` - The integer value of the priority, which defaults to `10`

### Labels

To change the name of the label in the menu:

```ruby
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Post do |config|
  config.menu_item_options = { label: "My Posts" }
end
```

If you want something more dynamic, pass a proc instead:

```ruby
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Post do |config|
  config.menu_item_options = { label: proc{ I18n.t "mypost" } }
end
```

### Menu Priority

Menu items are sorted first by their numeric priority, then alphabetically. Since
every menu by default has a priority of `10`, the menu is normally alphabetical.

You can easily customize this:

```ruby
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Post do |config|
  config.menu_item_options = { priority: 1 } # so it's on the very left
end
```

### Conditionally Showing / Hiding Menu Items

Menu items can be shown or hidden at runtime using the `:if` option.

```ruby
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Post do |config|
  config.menu_item_options = { if: proc{ current_user.can_edit_posts? } }
end
```

The proc will be called in the context of the view, so you have access to all
your helpers and current user session information.

### Drop Down Menus

In many cases, a single level navigation will not be enough to manage a large
application. In that case, you can group your menu items under a parent menu item.

```ruby
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Post do |config|
  config.menu_item_options = { parent: "Blog" }
end
```

Note that the "Blog" parent menu item doesn't even have to exist yet; it can be
dynamically generated for you.

### Customizing Parent Menu Items

All of the options given to a standard menu item are also available to
parent menu items. In the case of complex parent menu items, you should
configure them in the Active Admin initializer.

```ruby
# config/initializers/active_admin.rb
config.namespace :admin do |admin|
  admin.build_menu do |menu|
    menu.add label: 'Blog', priority: 0
  end
end

# app/admin/post.rb
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Post do |config|
  config.menu_item_options = { parent: 'Blog' }
end
```

### Dynamic Parent Menu Items

While the above works fine, what if you want a parent menu item with a dynamic
name? Well, you have to refer to it by its `:id`.

```ruby
# config/initializers/active_admin.rb
config.namespace :admin do |admin|
  admin.build_menu do |menu|
    menu.add id: 'blog', label: proc{"Something dynamic"}, priority: 0
  end
end

# app/admin/post.rb
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Post do |config|
  config.menu_item_options = { parent: 'blog' }
end
```

### Adding Custom Menu Items

Sometimes it's not enough to just customize the menu label. In this case, you
can customize the menu for the namespace within the Active Admin initializer.

```ruby
# config/initializers/active_admin.rb
config.namespace :admin do |admin|
  admin.build_menu do |menu|
    menu.add label: "The Application", url: "/", priority: 0

    menu.add label: "Sites" do |sites|
      sites.add label: "Google",
                url: "http://google.com",
                html_options: { target: :blank }

      sites.add label: "Facebook",
                url: "http://facebook.com"

      sites.add label: "Github",
                url: "http://github.com"
    end
  end
end
```

This will be registered on application start before your resources are loaded.

## Scoping the queries

If your administrators have different access levels, you may sometimes want to
scope what they have access to. Assuming your User model has the proper
has_many relationships, you can simply scope the listings and finders like so:

```ruby
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Post do |config|
  config.scope_to :current_user # limits the accessible posts to `current_user.posts`

  # Or if the association doesn't have the default name:
  config.scope_to :current_user, association_method: :blog_posts

  # Finally, you can pass a block to be called:
  config.scope_to do
    User.most_popular_posts
  end
end
```

You can also conditionally apply the scope:

```ruby
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Post do |config|
  config.scope_to :current_user, if:     proc{ current_user.limited_access? }
  config.scope_to :current_user, unless: proc{ current_user.admin? }
end
```

## Eager loading

A common way to increase page performance is to eliminate N+1 queries by eager
loading associations:

```ruby
class Admin::PostsController < ActiveAdmin::ResourceController
  def apply_includes(collection)
    collection.includes :author, :categories
  end
end
```

## Customizing resource retrieval

Our controllers are built on [Inherited
Resources](https://github.com/activeadmin/inherited_resources), so you can use
[all of its
features](https://github.com/activeadmin/inherited_resources#overwriting-defaults).

If you need to customize the collection properties, you can overwrite the
`scoped_collection` method.

```ruby
class Admin::PostsController < ActiveAdmin::ResourceController
  def scoped_collection
    end_of_association_chain.where(visibility: true)
  end
end
```

If you need to completely replace the record retrieving code (e.g., you have a
custom `to_param` implementation in your models), override the `resource` method
on the controller:

```ruby
class Admin::PostsController < ActiveAdmin::ResourceController
  def find_resource
    scoped_collection.where(id: params[:id]).first!
  end
end
```

Note that if you use an authorization library like CanCan, you should be careful
to not write code like this, otherwise **your authorization rules won't be
applied**:

```ruby
class Admin::PostsController < ActiveAdmin::ResourceController
  def find_resource
    Post.where(id: params[:id]).first!
  end
end
```

## Non-ActiveRecord resources

A resource can wrap any class that includes `ActiveModel::Model`, for example
jobs read from a queue backend. Override `scoped_collection` to return a
paginatable collection and `find_resource` to load a single record:

```ruby
class Admin::JobsController < ActiveAdmin::ResourceController
  actions :index, :show

  protected

  def scoped_collection
    Kaminari.paginate_array(Job.all)
  end

  def find_resource
    Job.find_by(id: params[:id])
  end
end
```

Without ActiveRecord there are no default columns, filters or comments, and
Ransack filtering and SQL sorting are skipped. Declare index columns explicitly
(they are not sortable unless given `sortable:`), and override `apply_filtering`
and `apply_sorting` to implement your own. Breadcrumbs call
`find_by(id => ...)` on the class when it responds to it.

## Belongs To

It's common to want to scope a series of resources to a relationship. For
example a Project may have many Milestones and Tickets. To nest the resource
within another, you can use the `belongs_to` method:

```ruby
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Project
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Ticket do |config|
  config.belongs_to :project
end
```

Projects will be available as usual and tickets will be available by visiting
`/admin/projects/1/tickets` assuming that a Project with the id of 1 exists.
Active Admin does not add "Tickets" to the global navigation because the routes
can only be generated when there is a project id.

To create links to the resource, you can add them to a sidebar (one of the many
possibilities for how you may with to handle your user interface):

```ruby
ActiveAdmin.register Project do

  sidebar "Project Details", only: [:show, :edit] do
    ul do
      li link_to "Tickets",    admin_project_tickets_path(resource)
      li link_to "Milestones", admin_project_milestones_path(resource)
    end
  end
end

ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Ticket do |config|
  config.belongs_to :project
end

ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Milestone do |config|
  config.belongs_to :project
end
```

In some cases (like Projects), there are many sub resources and you would
actually like the global navigation to switch when the user navigates "into" a
project. To accomplish this, Active Admin stores the `belongs_to` resources in a
separate menu which you can use if you so wish. To use:

```ruby
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Ticket do |config|
  config.belongs_to :project
  config.navigation_menu_name = :project
end

ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Milestone do |config|
  config.belongs_to :project
  config.navigation_menu_name = :project
end
```

Now, when you navigate to the tickets section, the global navigation will
only display "Tickets" and "Milestones". When you navigate back to a
non-belongs_to resource, it will switch back to the default menu.

You can also defer the menu lookup until runtime so that you can dynamically show
different menus, say perhaps based on user permissions. For example:

```ruby
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Ticket do |config|
  config.belongs_to :project
  config.navigation_menu_name = -> { authorized?(:manage, SomeResource) ? :project : :restricted_menu }
end
```

If you still want your `belongs_to` resources to be available in the default menu
and through non-nested routes, you can use the `:optional` option. For example:

```ruby
ActiveAdmin.configure_resource Ticket do |config|
  config.belongs_to :project, optional: true
end
```
