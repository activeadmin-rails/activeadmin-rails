# Active Admin for Rails Developers

[Active Admin](https://www.activeadmin.org) is a Ruby on Rails framework for creating elegant backends for website administration.

This is a significant fork of the original Active Admin project
starting in 2018 with v1.3.1 and abandoning v2.0.0.alpha started one year earlier.

This fork aims to make it simpler and more Rails-like without dropping the
rich functionality that made Active Admin a leading choice for a decade.
See [CHANGELOG] for more details.

Active Admin is open source software, [free as in puppy].
As of writing this software is in production with at least one mid-size business,
but Varyonic has no plans to provide commercial support - let us know if you do.
